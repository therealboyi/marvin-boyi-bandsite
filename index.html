                        The Bees Knees is a pop rock band originating from San Francisco,
                        California. The band consists a dynamic lineup featuring two lead
                        vocalists, two guitarists, a bassist, a keyboardist and a drummer.
                        The band achieved its first commercial success as an unsigned act,
                        drawing attention from their future manager. Having extensive
                        experience working with both new and seasoned acts, the manager
                        was confident the band could succeed even further with more
                        support, pushing The Bees Knees to sign with a well known record
                        label.
                    </p>
                    <p class="body-copy specific-text">
                        From there, the band has soared, gaining international recognition
                        and ranking in the top 10 on the Poster Charts. New fans
                        immediately fell in love with the band’s original and organic
                        attitude, solidifying their place as one of the hottest and
                        fastest up and coming acts of this century. Fans affectionately
                        refer to themselves as “The Hive” and are drawn to their candid
                        and authentic performances on stage. The Bees Knees are currently
                        recording their second studio album, looking to be released in
                        early 2024.
